# LAProgramScheduler

This program is a supplement to a Google Form that Learning Assistants will use to schedule sections. Using time preferences from groups of LAs, this project uses a greedy approach to schedule members from least preferred times to most preferred times. After an individual is scheduled for a section, the time is removed from everyone else's preferences in order to prevent conflicting sections. Once everyone is scheduled, names of LAs are tied to every section, and the final schedule is constructed. 

Created by Prateek Sane, Aryan Singh, Jackson Steele, and Abishan Sutharshan for the LA Final Project; to be used during the 2023-2024 year.
